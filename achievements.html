                  <h4>A Thriving City</h4>
                  <p class="indent-bot">The City of Burlington is experiencing a stable financial status, thanks to the
                    prosperous businesses that have been contributing to record-breaking sales tax revenues the last few
                    years combined with underspending of the city budget. The current sales tax revenue is on track to
                    set
                    another record, while the reserve account balances are at an all-time high level, making the future
                    of
                    the city secure. Later this year, I will again present a balanced budget to the Council with no
                    increase in property tax rates. </p>

                  <h4>A Growing City</h4>
                  <p class="img-indent-bot">Burlington is currently seeing an unprecedented rise in mixed-use projects
                    that combine commercial spaces with multi-family housing. In the last 4 years, 32% of Skagit
                    County's
                    population growth has been in Burlington due to the construction of these new projects. With larger
                    projects currently underway, we can expect this growth to continue in the coming years. It is a
                    source
                    of immense pride when builders and developers express interest in taking on more projects in
                    Burlington.
                    However, this growth also poses a challenge to city services, especially our traffic system. If we
                    continue to grow without proper planning and improvements to traffic flow, the weak spots in our
                    current system will only worsen.
                    <strong>Unfortunately, my opponent has hindered our progress by voting against a $1.7 million grant
                      that the
                      city had received to improve the George Hopper/I-5 interchange, an area heavily impacted by
                      growth.</strong>

                <div id="SafeCityDiv">
                  <h4>Citizen Saftey</h4>
                  <p class="img-indent-bot">The Burlington Police Department, along with other departments in Washington
                    State, is experiencing a
                    shortage of personnel. However, we stand firm in maintaining our high standards despite a decline in
                    both the quantity and quality of applications. Our commitment to professionalism and safety is
                    reflected
                    in the fact that in the past 12 years, we have responded to over 120,000 service calls without
                    receiving
                    a single complaint of excessive force. To address the staffing shortage in 2022, I brought to
                    Council a
                    bonus payment initiative to incentivize experienced officers to transfer to our city. This program
                    has
                    enabled us to hire 6 experienced officers at a budgetary savings of approximately $480,000 if we had
                    been able to hire new officers.
                    We will continue to utilize this program as an effective tool to fulfill our staffing needs while
                    preserving our standards. <Strong>Conversely, my opponent voted against accepting a grant we had
                      been
                      awarded that would have funded 2 officers.</Strong>

                    In the upcoming months, I will ask for the Council's approval of a plan I previously introduced to
                    them.
                    The plan involves the City of Burlington contributing $100,000 to the Skagit County Sheriff's
                    Office.
                    The funds will go towards supporting the Skagit County Inter-Agency Drug Unit. This contribution is
                    necessary, as our officer assigned to the unit has moved out of state to continue their career in
                    law
                    enforcement. Until we can assign another officer to the unit, the budgeted amount for the officer
                    will
                    serve as a contribution. It recognizes the level of service provided to the City of Burlington by
                    SCIDU
                    in combating not only drug crimes but a wide range of other serious infractions.

                  <h4>Combating Homelessness</h4>
                  <p class="img-indent-bot"> <strong>Despite my opponent's objections and consistent votes against
                      it,</strong> I
                    successfully established the Skagit First Step Center in partnership with Skagit County and other
                    cities in 2021. The SFSC, situated on Pease Rd. in Burlington, includes 45 "cabins" and a large
                    building that offers crucial services. Residents can stay for up to 90 days, and the center records
                    an average of nearly 15,000 bed nights including nearly 500 law enforcement drop-offs annually. This
                    initiative has helped individuals who would have otherwise been sleeping in our public spaces,
                    sidewalks, or parks.
                    Thanks to the partnership with other cities and the county, I managed to set up the SFSC without
                    utilizing Burlington General Fund dollars for construction or operations. Despite this, my opponent
                    still voted against the establishment of the SFSC, and even dubbed it a "failure".
                    While the SFSC has achieved its intended purpose of getting individuals off the streets and
                    providing them with basic social services, it has brought to light a county-wide need for
                    transitional housing that has existed for years.
                    With this in mind, we have developed initial designs for a renovated facility at the SFSC site. This
                    new facility would offer longer-term transitional housing and additional social services, all in one
                    location. In this legislative climate, there are multiple grant funding opportunities for the
                    construction of such a facility.
